# We'll create a function that takes in two parameters:
# a sequence (length and types of items are irrelevant)
# a function (value, index) that will be called on members of the 
# sequence and their index. The function will return either true or false.
# Your function will iterate through the members of the sequence in 
# order until the provided function returns true; at which point your function will return that item's index.
