# Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces
#  is valid. It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

# This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets 
# [], and curly braces {}. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!
