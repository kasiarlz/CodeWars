# Ordering food
# You are in charge of ordering food for a party. You are going to need 4 sandwiches, 6 salads, 5 wraps,
#  and 10 orders of french fries. The cost per item of food is:

# food	price
# sandwich	$8.00
# salad	$7.00
# wrap	$6.50
# french fries	$1.20
# Create 4 variables to store the quantity of each type of food with the following names:

# sandwiches
# salads
# wraps
# frenchFries
# Create a variable named totalPrice that finds the cost of all of the food.


sandwiches, sandwichePrice = 4, 8.0
salads, saladPrice = 6, 7.0
wraps, wrapPrice = 5, 6.5
frenchFries, frenchFriesPrice = 10, 1.2
totalPrice = sum([
    sandwiches * sandwichePrice,
    salads * saladPrice,
    wraps * wrapPrice,
    frenchFries * frenchFriesPrice
])
