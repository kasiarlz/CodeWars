# Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. 
# The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b. a is "close to" b
#  if margin is higher than or equal to the difference between a and b.

# When a is lower than b, return -1.

# When a is higher than b, return 1.

# When a is close to b, return 0.

# When a is close to b, return 0.
